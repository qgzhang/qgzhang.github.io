### Biography

Since 2023, I have been working at the **Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)**, focusing on emerging Large Language Models (LLMs).  

From 2021 to 2023, I founded **Coin Master P2P**, successfully managing a profitable cryptocurrency portfolio, demonstrating entrepreneurial skills and financial acumen.  

Between 2018 and 2021, I was a **Research Fellow** at the **University of Queensland** and **Queensland University of Technology**, applying AI to the early diagnosis of skin cancer.  

I earned my **Ph.D. in Computer Science** from the **University of Adelaide**, with research spanning **structure from motion**, **SLAM**, **computational geometry**, and **robust statistics**. During this time, I was also affiliated with the [**Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML)**](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/).  

Prior to academia, I spent five years as a **Senior Software Engineer** at the **Agricultural Bank of China (ABC)**, beginning in July 2007.
