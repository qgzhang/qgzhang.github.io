### Biography

I am working as a researcher in Motovis Australia Ltd Pty.  My research relates to vehicle localisation and SLAM.

I freshly graduated as a Ph.D student from the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/), [The University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/). Research topics include

* structure from motion
* SLAM
* computational geometry
* robust statistics.

I was also affiliated with the [Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML)](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/). 

I had been a senior software engineer at the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) for 5 years since July 2007.
