### Biography

I am a Ph.D student at the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/), [The University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/) since March 2015. I am also affiliated with the [Australian Centre for Robotic Vision (ACRV)](https://blogs.adelaide.edu.au/acvt/). My research topics include 

* structure from motion
* SLAM
* computational geometry
* robust statistics.

I had been a senior software engineer at the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) for 5 years since July 2007.

Here is my [CV](cv.pdf)
