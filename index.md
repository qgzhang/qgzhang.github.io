### Biography

I am a research fellow in the University of Queensland since 2019 working on early skin cancer dignosis. 

I was a Ph.D student from the University of Adelaide. Research topics include structure from motion, SLAM, computational geometry and robust statistics.

I was also affiliated with the [Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML)](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/). 

I had been a senior software engineer at the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) for 5 years since July 2007.

My CV can be found [here](https://qgzhang.github.io/Qianggong_Zhang_CV.pdf).
